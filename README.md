# Bloomsense
 Unity Mobile Application
- In today's fast-paced world, many people are disconnected from nature, yet there is a growing interest in bringing greenery into living spaces, whether through gardening or houseplants . However, one of the biggest challenges for plant enthusiasts, especially beginners, is identifying the right plants and understanding how to care for them properly . Misidentification and lack of knowledge often lead to poor plant health and frustration . Inspired by the desire to make plant care accessible and enjoyable for everyone, we embarked on the development of Bloomsense. By leveraging augmented reality in Bloomsense, we strive to make learning about plants both engaging and educational

Bloomsense is a user-friendly app designed to help users quickly identify plants, receive personalized care instructions, and connect with a community of plant enthusiasts who share their knowledge and experiences.

The prototype was created with proto io , helping us in the mock-up and ideation process. Afterwards, Unity was utilized to create the augmented reality experience. Together with the Vuforia package and Cloud Recognition Framework.

We utilized blender objects or Free 3D Models from the internet, in order to bring the Reality Augmented to life.
